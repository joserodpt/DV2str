## Project Overview

The **DV Timecode Extractor Tool** is a program developed in **Python**, and later on converted to **C++**, to extract the **timecode** data (following the **DD** / **MM** / **YYYY** **HH** : **mm** : **ss** Format) from **DV video streams**, encapsulated in **.avi** files, and generate **.srt** files, that could be ser embedded in **.mp4** containers.

There's also a project that contains the same ideia applied for **.mp4** camcorder files, called [mp4str](https://github.com/joserodpt/mp42str).

## Features

- Precise extraction of Date timecodes, directly from DV (**.avi**) into **.srt** files.
- Offers support for both **NTSC** and **PAL** streaming systems.

## How DV2str Works

1. The **.avi** file is opened
2. The header is analysed, cycling through the most relevant **chunks**.
3. It searches for subcode packages (such as **pack62** and **pack63**), which hold all the **Time and Date** information from the file.
4. It **decodes and checks for any errors** in the extracted data, **returning the timecode** formated on a more readable state.
5. The Information is then ready to be **exported as a .srt file**, or used in any other way intended.


## (.avi) file format - Header References

NOTE: All the following references are based on **.avi** File Format Research Databases.
Go on (https://xoax.net/sub_web/ref_dev/fileformat_avi/) to find more information regarding the Audio Video Interleave (avi) File Format.
- **RIFF Header**: Defines the file as an **.avi** type
- **Chunks "hdrl"**: Contains all metadata from the file (such as the it's resolution, etc...)
- **Chunks "movi"**: Contains all Multiplexed Audio and Video data.
- **Chunks "idx1"**: Although optional, it can be used to index the frames, making navigation on the file much more efficient.


## DV Format in .avi
The DV format encapsulates digital video (DV) in data packets with a specific structure. Each DV frame contains timecode subcodes that can be extracted for use in editing or analysis.

The DV Data Extraction Process:
- Identify video data chunks in the **.avi** file (typically located in the "movi" chunk).
- Read 80-byte DV packets, which include:
  - Timecodes: Information such as hour, minute, second, and frame number.
  - Auxiliary subcodes: Used for synchronization and error correction.

NOTE: The source code in this project uses logic similar to that found in WinDV(https://github.com/hfiggs/WinDV/blob/main/DV.cpp) to identify and interpret encapsulated DV packets.


### Main Functions
- **get_dv_recording_time(data, name, offset)**: Extracts and verifies the Date and Time from the data stream.
- **get_ssyb_pack(data, pack_num)**: Finds specific subcode packages on the stream.
- **parse_riff_header(file)**: Analyses the RIFF Header from the file.
- **parse_idx1(file, offset)**: Locates the chunks index on the file.


### Debugging with '-d' Flag
The -d (debug) flag provides detailed information when executing the program, to assist in troubleshooting. 
When enabled, the program outputs:
- **Raw DV packet data for inspection.**
- **Frame timecodes and subcodes extracted from the AVI file.**
- **Any anomalies or errors encountered during processing.**

This is particularly useful for validating DV data integrity and analyzing specific frames in the video stream.

## How to Install

1. **First, make sure you have:**
    - Python 3.x installed.
    - NOTE: It is not mandatory (but certainly advisable) that all the main Python Libraries are already pre-installed and fully working on your device.

2. **Clone this repository using git (NOTE: although not recommended, you can opt to download this repository directly from the GitHub source).**

3. **Execute the main script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py <path_to_the_avi_file>
    ```

4. **Output**:
   - The Date and timecode will then be shown on your device's Terminal.
